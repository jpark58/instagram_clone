## Firebase

In this project, firbase is used to implement features of back-end, such as user-authentication, database, and deployment.

### User Authentication

Using authentication feature in firebase, allowed a user to sign-up, login, and sign-out in realtime.

### Database

In database, once a user upload a post, a document will be created and named "posts". The "posts" document collection contains username, imageUrl, text.  
React is going to render the window everytime a user posts.
